# Fundamental C Collection

This repository is designed for those who want to learn and practice the C programming language. It contains sample files aimed at teaching fundamental concepts of the C language. Each file contains a tutorial exercise to explain a C concept, accompanied by explanatory comments.

## Contents

Some of the key topics covered in the repository include:

- Variables and Data Types
- Control Structures (if-else, switch-case)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Structures
- File Handling

## How to Use

Each C file is named to indicate the concept it covers. For instance, `3-simple_calculator.c` teaches the usage of the `scanf` function through a simple calculator example.

Each file includes detailed explanations in comments. These comments help understand what the code does and why it's written that way.
